for i in range(0,51):
    if(i%2!=0&i%3!=0):
        print(i)

Explaination:
1. The for loop ranges from 0 to 50 (as 51 isn’t exclusive).
2. The expression within the if-statement checks if the remainder obtained when the number divided by 2 and 3 is one or not.
3. If the remainder isn’t equal to 0, the number isn’t divisible by either 2 and 3.
4. The number satisfying the condition is printed.
